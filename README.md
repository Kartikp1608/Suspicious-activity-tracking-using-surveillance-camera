## 🌟 Key Features
- **Activity Recognition**: Detects various suspicious activities such as loitering, unauthorized access, or physical altercations.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes advanced algorithms for feature extraction and classification.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Capable of analyzing live video streams for immediate alerts.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Can be extended to multiple surveillance cameras.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks & Libraries**:
  - OpenCV: For video processing and object detection.
  - TensorFlow/Keras: For model training and inference.
  - NumPy & Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Other Tools**: Pretrained action recognition models for improved accuracy.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- **Video Clips**: Annotated surveillance footage with suspicious and normal activity.
- **Labels**: Clearly defined categories for various suspicious behaviors.
- **Preprocessing**: Frame extraction, resizing, and normalization to prepare for model training.

## 🚀 Workflow
1. **Frame Extraction**:
   - Videos are split into individual frames for processing.
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Deep learning models identify patterns and anomalies in the frames.
3. **Classification**:
   - Frames are classified into normal or suspicious activities.
4. **Alert Generation**:
   - For suspicious frames, the system generates real-time alerts.
